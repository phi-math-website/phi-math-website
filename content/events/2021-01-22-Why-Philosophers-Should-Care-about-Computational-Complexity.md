Next reading meeting will touch on theoretical computer science. We will be seeing how computational complexity can potentially offer new insights into philosophy of mathematics. We will be reading Scott Aaronson's survey paper *Why Philosophers Should Care about Computational Complexity*.

For the meeting, we expect attendants to read in advance sections 1-5, 8-9 and 12 of the paper, [available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1791). 

The meeting will have a presentation by Andrea and Noel, followed, as usual, by a discussion.

Slides used in the presentation are [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UYkBRsN45IZ14SI9TyHhiMEdBj3cw3-/view?usp=sharing). Noel's paper about proof complexity is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ChGTCSdVgZCxc4dZETclTN-cuWOXXCPx/view?usp=sharing).
