This time we take a recourse to mereology! In his talk, Elias Bronner will introduce the philosophical motivations for the field, Le≈õniewski's nominalistic position.  Further, we will discuss basic mereology and its relation to Boolean Algebras. Elias will conclude with touching upon a recent interpretation of mereology within set theory by J.D. Hamkins which suggests that mereology is too weak of a system to serve as a foundation for mathematics.
