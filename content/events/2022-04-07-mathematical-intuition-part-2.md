In relation to the first chapter of "Mathematical Intuition" by Richard Tiszen, we discussed some notions of Husserl's phenomenology that pertain to the categorial intuition.

**Derek So** introduced us to some basic concepts of Husserl's phenomenology. We focused on intentionality, synthetic and eidetic intuition. Then briefly discussed the different conceptions of intuition in more contemporary phenomenology.
