For our second meeting on Structuralism in mathematics, we will be focusing on the category-theoretical side of the discussion. Stemming from work in algebraic topology, category theory has since the 1950's become an indisposable tool for mainstream mathematics and is seen by some to encode the structuralist philosophy into mathematics itself. We will be reading and discussing some thoughts around the plausibility of using category-theoretic foundations for mathematics and whether this really follows the structuralist philosophy.
