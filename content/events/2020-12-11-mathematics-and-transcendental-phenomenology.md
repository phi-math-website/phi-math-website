Our third reading will be Richard Tieszen's  Richard's *Mathematics and Transcendental Phenomenology*.

For this session we expect attendants to have read in advance the full second chapter from the book containing the essay; that is:

- Tieszen, R. (2005). Mathematics and Transcendental Phenomenology. In *Phenomenology, Logic, and the Philosophy of Mathematics* (pp. 46â€“68),  Chapter 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

The text can be accessed freely by University of Amsterdam students through [this link to the library catalogue](https://lib.uva.nl/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&vid=31UKB_UAM1_INST:UVA&search_scope=DN_and_CI_and_PURE&tab=Everything&docid=alma9940205307105131). 
(Recently there have been problems when accessing online collections, so it might be necessary to open the link on an incognito tab).

During the session, Derek will present the paper, followed by a discussion.
