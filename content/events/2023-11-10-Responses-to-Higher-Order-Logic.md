We are continuing our discussion about Higher-Order Logic (HOL), this time focusing specifically on arguments against adopting Higher-Order logics for various purposes. These arguments range from (HOL) being set theory in disguise, the (lack of) applicability of (HOL) for its intended purposes, and the serious metalogical issues the logic faces.
