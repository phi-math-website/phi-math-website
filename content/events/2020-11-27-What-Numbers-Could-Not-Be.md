Our second reading will be Paul Benacerraf's *What Numbers Could Not Be*.

For this session we expect attendants to have read in advance:

- Benacerraf, Paul. "What Numbers Could Not Be." The Philosophical Review 74, no. 1 (1965): 47-73.

The article can be accessed freely by University of Amsterdam students [through JSTOR, by logging in with the institution](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183530?seq=1).

During the session, Evan will present the paper, followed by a discussion.
