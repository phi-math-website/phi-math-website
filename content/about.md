Î¦-Math is a reading group in **philosophy of mathematics** from the [Institute
for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://illc.uva.nl) at the
University of Amsterdam.

The group meets **every other Friday** over the course of the academic year to
present and discuss academic work in the philosophy of mathematics and its
related fields. This year we hope to see **guest lecturers** and to give
participants ample opportunity to both present and ask questions about these
topics.
