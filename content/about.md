Φ-Math is a reading group in **philosophy of mathematics** from the [Institute
for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://illc.uva.nl) at the
University of Amsterdam.

Φ-Math was co-founded at 2020 by the first-year [Master of Logic
(MoL)](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) students at the time [Evan
Iatrou](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/people/alumnus/5123/Evangelos-Iatrou) and
[Noel Arteche](https://narteche.github.io/). It has since then been chaired by
the MoL student [Jan
Gronwald](https://www.illc.uva.nl/People/Alumni/alumnus/5225/Jan-Gronwald) and
is currently managed by third year student [Alexander
Lind](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/people/person/5398/Alexander-Lind) and second
year student [Orestis Dimou
Belegratis](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/people/person/5551/Orestis-Dimou-Belegratis).

And a special thanks to [Stefano Volpe](https://www.illc.uva.nl/People/Table/person/5520/Stefano-Volpe) for his great help with this new and improved website.

The group currently meets **every other Friday** over the course of the academic year to
present and discuss academic work in the philosophy of mathematics and its
related fields. This year we hope to see **guest lecturers** and to give
participants ample opportunity to both present and ask questions about these
topics.
